// Ask if user wants to play, if yes, set a boolean runGame to true.
// Initialize an array of three options (rock, paper or scissors).

// Store the computers chosen index option to a local variable.
// While there is no game winner (5 wins per match) continue asking user for rock, paper or scissors.
// Add roshambo logic through a nested if statement in the while loop.
// If user selection beats computer selection, user wins, else computer wins.
// Initialize two variables to store amount of wins for player and computer.
// Send user a message to let them know if their chosen tool beats the computers or not.
// Display amount of wins for player and amount of wins for computer.

// If the user has 5 wins, declare that 'they won!'
// Set runGame to false.
// If the computer has 5 wins, declare that 'they lost :(' and add a 'new game?' option.
